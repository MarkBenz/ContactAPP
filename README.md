This is a **fullstack** demo application I built during a online Course.

The **backend** is built with **Express.js** and **MongoDB** as database.
The Frontend is built with **REACT**, using the **Context API** and **hooks**.

The User can Register/Login and add Contacts to a List and also filter,edit or delete them.

The Application can be started with the command `npm run dev`. You need to be in the root directory and you need to have Node installed on your System to run **npm**.
